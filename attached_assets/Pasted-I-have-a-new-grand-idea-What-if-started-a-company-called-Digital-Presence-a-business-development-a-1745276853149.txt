I have a new grand idea! What if started a company called Digital Presence, a business development app for sole proprietors and partnerships, that helps a user walk through building an online presence for their business, with branding and social media services, scheduling etc., or to start their dream business, using our services to build and host their ultimate online presence, with an option to apply for our tiers of staff services or office support, marketing, everything, a membership where they can pay slightly less than what it would cost them to do it themselves or to hire staff of their own, we could be a fully collectively owned company, with different levels of services or add on's, of our collective staff to be on hand 24 hours a day, as a group that shares an even distribution of our monthly revenue, run businesses of our own, if we vote to, voted on in the complete staff forum weekly, run our accounting on blockchain for complete transparency, with a fully transparently collective staff governed decision making process that manages distribution and growth with the profits after a set amount for platform maintenance costs, which is also voted on every five years by the collective staff members. The only permanent fixtures being collective operated and even salary distribution, by the founding team of the first members which is consisting of staff this way: we start out with my state, the State of Texas, and work our way through each state, one at a time, as the collective staff staff from each decide to move forward and grow, We could have a full staff of every kind of office support each kind of business needs, hiring experts who have been replaced by AI, working remotely on their own schedules, to help our clients reach their full potential,  30 staff members from each state with 3 rotating moderators out of that 30, rotating quarterly, out of those who have selected the "offer to manage" check box on their dashboard, who will meet on the staff forum throughout the week with the full thirty and meet together on the manager forum weekly for 3 - 5 hours for business and development planning, and additionally within 7 days and one month of the first week of the new quarter, vote on distribution amount for the next quarter, a monthly salary that each staff the same amount, no matter what their job is, no matter what kind of performance they contribute, but voted on being kept on that tier or moved up a tier, all decided based on competency of looking out for the whole group, a purely prestigious gravitation. Additionally, after helping each sole proprietor,  who are voted in to get to use our service, after thorough evaluation, making being our client prestigious and coveted, have the yearly option, if voted in for the annual client membership invite, can be invited to join on a annual client membership bases, which is much cheaper and has a hire level of marketing and after that, if their business gets voted in, they can become business client staff, and join our team, up to 30 for each original 30, in each state, with the same rotation arrangement as the office staff portion of members, and the same tiers of prestige, and again always the salary is even distribution, giving every member motivation to contribute as much as possible. The whole scheme is revaluated every 7 years after the 1st week and within one month of the first month of the following quarter. Membership will always be governed collectively, as described, each group of three over no more than thirty and can grow by making new groups of 3 by area, and groups of thirty their voting is on behalf of, continuing on as so forth. What do you think?
