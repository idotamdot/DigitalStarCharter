# Governance System Proposals

This document outlines three distinct governance system proposals for Digital Presence, each from a different perspective.

## 1. Meritocracy with Contribution-Based Voting

This system is designed to reward active and valuable contributors with greater decision-making power.

- **Contribution Tracking:** All contributions to the platform are tracked and assigned a "Merit" score. This includes code commits, bug fixes, documentation, community support, and mentorship.
- **Voting Power:** A member's voting power is directly proportional to their Merit score. The higher the score, the more their vote is worth.
- **Leadership:** Leadership positions are filled by members with the highest Merit scores in their respective domains.
- **Dispute Resolution:** A council of the top Merit-holders is responsible for resolving disputes and making final decisions on contentious issues.

## 2. Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

This model leverages blockchain technology to create a fully decentralized and transparent governance system.

- **Governance Tokens:** Members are issued governance tokens that represent their stake in the organization. These tokens can be earned through contributions or purchased.
- **Smart Contracts:** All governance rules and voting mechanisms are encoded in smart contracts on a public blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **Proposals:** Any member can submit a proposal for a vote. Proposals are then voted on by all token-holders.
- **Treasury:** The organization's treasury is managed by the DAO, and all expenditures must be approved by a vote of the token-holders.

## 3. Liquid Democracy with Delegated Voting

This system combines direct democracy with representative democracy, allowing members to either vote on issues themselves or delegate their vote to a trusted expert.

- **Direct Voting:** Members can vote directly on any proposal.
- **Delegation:** Members can delegate their vote to another member who they believe is more knowledgeable about a particular topic.
- **Transitive Delegation:** Delegations can be transitive. For example, if Alice delegates her vote to Bob, and Bob delegates his vote to Carol, then Carol can cast all three votes.
- **Revocability:** Delegations can be revoked at any time, allowing members to retain ultimate control over their vote.
