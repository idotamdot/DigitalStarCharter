# Governance System 

compile a list of all labor skills that encompasses every kind of work, and make a plan to include all types of labor in as much as all members agree to equal profit distribution regardless of skill level or types of skill. Let's see how many people understand fair right and good. The idea is we all benefit from the effort of all of us without fear of someone getting a free ride because we are about the liberty it will bring and the beauty of a world without war so we can advance and prosper with a thriving of our kind.
